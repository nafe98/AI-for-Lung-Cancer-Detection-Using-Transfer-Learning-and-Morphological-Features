In general the paper is interesting however several aspects need additional attention:


a) Precision results should agree with confusion matrices. This is not always the case as we have 100% success in the confusion matrix and under 100% precision in some cases.


b) Why is the number of cases in the DL confusion matrix different?


c) Why vgg16 when there are better and lighter alternatives?


d) Probably there is no need to include all proposed ML alternatives


e) Does any of the compared works use the same dataset?


f) Is data augmentation used? Otherwise the number of cases is too small.


g) Some issues should be revised. E.g. the first phrase "Lung cancer is generally ... No need for generally at least for the cases in the dataset.
